    <name>Sample From BN</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Using a Bayesian network which describes densities of probabilities, 
        this node generates a population of entities (data table) 
        with columns corresponding the variables of the BN.

        <intro>
        Using a Bayesian network which describes densities of probabilities, 
        this node generates a data table  
        with columns corresponding the variables of the BN, and the content of cells being the categories of the variables.
        <br/>
        Computing time depends on the size of the Bayesian network: size of the Conditional Probability Tables, 
        count of them. 
        The behavior is not linear thanks to caching of computations: the more lines your compute, the quicker it goes.
        <br/>
        The random numbers are generated using the <a href="https://dst.lbl.gov/ACSSoftware/colt/">Colt library</a> 
        (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(libraries)">the wikipedia page</a>) published by CERN.

        <option name="Samples">How many lines to sample (generate)</option>
        <option name="Seed">Enables you to freeze the Random Number Generator used to sample. 
        If you do not understand what this means, keep it unchecked so a different result is produced at every run.</option>
        <option name="group similar rows">If several rows are similar, grouping will add a column count and indicate the count there; 
        else one row will be created for each result</option>
