    <name>Augment Sample With BN</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Adds additional columns based on the probabilities from a Bayesian network.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        Adds columns to the table by adding all the variables of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian Network</a> which are not yet columns of the datatable. 
        To generate the values of the additional columns, the node will try to find all the column names which match the 
        name of a variable of the Bayesian network, and will use them as evidence to condition the probabilities of the 
        missing columns with the ones of the existing ones.
        
        <p>For instance, if the input table contains this data:</p>
        <table>
		  <tr>
		    <th>age</th>
		    <th>gender</th>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>baby</td>
		    <td>male</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>teen</td>
		    <td>?</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>adult</td>
		    <td>?</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>baby</td>
		    <td>female</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>?</td>
		    <td>female</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>adult</td>
		    <td>?</td>
		  </tr>		  
		</table>
		<p>and if the Bayesian network describes probabilities <tt>p(age,gender,location)</tt>, then the 
		node will replace the missing values in the table, and add the additional column <tt>location</tt>, 
		by sampling randomly (according to the Bayesian network probabilities).
		</p>
		
        <p>
        Computing time depends on the size of the Bayesian network: size of the Conditional Probability Tables, 
        count of them. 
        The behavior is not linear thanks to caching of computations: the more lines your compute, the quicker it goes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In case some columns used as evidence in the Bayesian networks contain missing values, 
        the computation will use the probabilities described in the Bayesian network to 
        compute a result anyway.
        </p>
